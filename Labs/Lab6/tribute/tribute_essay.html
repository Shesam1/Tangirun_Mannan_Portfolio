	<p>Star Shade<br> by Tangirun Mannan<br></p>
<p>Long has the word been that I was birthed from the waters of Avalon. A prophecy was foretold on that day that from whence I came soon I will go back to, with nary a husband, child nor friend. Cursed was the name first given to me, and then came the others, friendless, loveless, pitiful, woeful the fairy lady of Shalott. All my names were both “less” and “full” but never really either. I’d like to think that none of those names ever really applied to me; after all I did have a friend. Just one, but a friend nonetheless, and I called her Irro. She may have been my only friend but we did everything together; we ate, laughed, cried and weaved our tapestry. She was all I had. Together we passed the blending, monotonous days weaving the black and grays of our glance of the world.  Once in a while a red or yellow would grace our looms, but ever constant were the serene silver streams that slivered through our woven canvases. The lightening or darkening of the veil of sky, depending on the movement of the sun, was one of our favorite subjects.</p>

<p> Especially the moment when the sky hung dark blue over the river, littered with flashes of the stars. Irro loved weaving this view the most. “Starshades,” she called them. Alive, twinkling brilliantly for only a brief moment on the water’s surface, but forgotten and gone with a mere ripple of the tide. They were burning afterimages of beings long gone. It was on these particular nights that we would notice upstream on the river bank opposite the glow of the white lilies, a tall shadowy figure. He was cloaked in a sweeping, dark, roughly shorn garment and waved to us with a gleaming sway of his hand. The man, ever so kind and patient, would often float our way the blooming white lilies strewn about the river side. Never did he ever take one step past the foggy banks full of decaying barley and rye, and he lingered about our tower. Curious a figure he was to Irro and I, as we would often muse to ourselves if he was but a trick of sight in the bathing light of the moon. Come morning, the trivialities of the night forgotten, we’d set to the task of weaving the colors of the new day.</p> 

<p>Life continues this way, day after day, Irro and I passing the hours solely in each other’s company.  The prophecy that loomed over me did not seem so terrible. If I never looked to Camelot then the years of my life shall surely stretch farther. To stay in this tower is to stay away from Camelot. To stay away from Camelot is to stay away from my cursed fate. I ensure my survival by staying atop this ivory tower, and never daring to look upon Camelot directly. Irro kept me in check constantly, and I never strayed from her eyes for too long. I have lived all these years looking upon Camelot through her eyes.</p>
 
<p>It happened that one day just as Irro was weaving in the glint of gold off of the river’s surface, a beam of colorful light flashes intrusively next to her into my eyes. Blinded by the sheer brilliance of it, I reflexively look away and feel my hands let go of the tapestry which begins to unravel to the floor. My vision is bombarded with the sight of a vividly plumed figure blazing with the light of the sun. It is Camelot. The rest of my senses come back to me and in that moment I become aware of a splintering sound behind me. Immediately I look to Irro, and see a small crack splitting across her face. Alarmed, I swiftly reach out to her as she stares back at me with fearful eyes. The moment I touch her she breaks apart into my hands and shatters to the floor. I look at my hands, at the fragments of the mirror cutting into my palms and see myself for the first time. In a daze, my feet lead me to the stairs winding out of the tower and into the cold dewy air that awaits me outside my prison.</p>
  
<p>I am Irro, and Irro is me. Irro cannot exist without me, and I am nothing without Irro. Irro never existed. I never existed. Friendless, Loveless, and Worthless are my names; the fairy lady of Shallot. I am Starshade, with no one to reflect my existence. Who will remember me? They say that banshees cry when good men die. Who will wail for my passing? Is it Sir Death who eagerly awaits my arrival on the other side of the river? Nay, I will not be forgotten. To Camelot I shall go, to the beautifully plumed Sun child. He will remember my face. I carve a name into the stern of the boat, nameless though I may be and steer a passage to Camelot. Lying down in my bed of lilies and satin I muse to myself. If I had never exiled myself from society, seeing all for what it was and not how they were reflected would I not have been fine from this “curse?” In trying to prevent this pretend curse, I have cursed myself. The air is getting colder and I cannot move my fingers. I slowly blink the frost off my lashes, just a little more I tell myself. Soon I will see Camelot and Camelot will see me.</p>
